    "Coercive control existed long before it was named in statute. What happened to me, to my children, and now to my grandchildren—wasn’t suddenly made wrong in 2015. It always was. The only thing that changed was the willingness of law to acknowledge it. And yet, the current attitude—refusing to correct falsehoods that continue to divide generations—is itself psychological abuse. There is no crime in telling the truth. But there is deep moral failure in knowing the truth, and still choosing silence. Especially when that silence punishes everyone except the person who caused the harm.\n",
