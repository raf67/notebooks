    "\n",
    "To: Essex Police Professional Standards Department  \n",
    "Subject: Procedural Disclosure — Bail-to-Return Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear Sir/Madam,\n",
    "\n",
    "I respectfully request full disclosure of my bail-to-return scheduling history between March 2024 and June 2025, as issued or managed by Essex Police.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Records Requested\n",
    "\n",
    "Please provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Full schedule of bail-to-return instructions issued to me\n",
    "- Officer(s) in charge of each appearance\n",
    "- Any internal memos, logs, or rescheduling notices\n",
    "- Justification or action-outcome notes where applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "I was subject to eight or more bail-to-return events during this period. These involved:\n",

    "- No staff present to receive me on multiple occasions  \n",
    "- Letters arriving after bail dates had passed  \n",
    "- Periods where no valid bail date or conditions were held  \n",
    "- Psychological harm and administrative confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "One such incident on 30 May 2025 at Grays Police Station resulted in unlawful ejection despite me complying fully with the bail request.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Legal Foundation\n",

    "\n",
    "- PACE 1984 — s.23 (supervision of bail)\n",

    "- Reasonable necessity to examine misconduct via administrative pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Please confirm receipt and expected time of response.\n",

    "Kind regards,  \n",
