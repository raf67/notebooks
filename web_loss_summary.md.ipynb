    "# Digital Loss Summary — Platform Disruption & Earnings Blocked\n",
    "\n",
    "Between mid-2024 and mid-2025, multiple legal and technical disruptions prevented the operation of richardfrancis.info and suspended access to eBay account functions. These outages occurred during critical bail periods and legal escalation, compounding personal harm with commercial loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Hosting Interruption – richardfrancis.info\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to card changes linked to systemic stress and legal chaos, AWS stopped processing hosting payments. Result: the website, which had become the primary outlet for countering reputational harm and publishing supporting evidence, went offline without warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimated Opportunity Loss: £150/month (typical traffic estimate)\n",
    "- Duration: ~4–6 months\n",
    "- Value Lost: £600–£900 in direct cash traffic\n",
    "- Additional Harm:\n",
    "  - Search engine de-ranking\n",
    "  - Public perception of unreliability\n",
    "  - Missed advocacy traction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. eBay Activity Suspension\n",
    "\n",
    "Ongoing bail constraints and emotional fatigue from systemic mistreatment rendered eBay operations unsustainable. No stock managed or sold, and account likely suffered rating decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average Monthly Revenue (proven): £100\n",
    "- Estimated Impact: 6–12 months\n",
    "- Value Lost: £600–£1,200\n",
    "- Recovery burden: account restoration, user trust rebuild\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Reputational Harm — Trust Erosion\n",
    "\n",
    "Offline digital assets created long-term reputational drift. Counter-parties, supporters, and agencies may now perceive the claimant as unstable or inactive — undermining public narrative, compensation campaigns, and digital reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“If he disappeared once, it might happen again.”*  \n",
    "> This perception was not caused by choice — it was imposed via digital immobilisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know when you’re ready to update `damages.md` with this language. I can write the table row for `comp.html` and draft a loss calculator in Python if you’d like `damages.py` to accept partial-month ranges or uncertain intervals. This isn’t just revenue lost. It’s narrative interrupted."
